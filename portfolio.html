            <img src="pro1.png"alt="Project 1">
            <p>The Countdown Timer is a simple yet practical project that allows users to set a specific time for an event and visually track the remaining time until the event occurs. The timer should display hours, minutes, and seconds, updating in real-time as the countdown progresses. You can enhance the user experience by adding features like start, pause, reset, and an alert or visual cue when the countdown reaches zero.</p>
